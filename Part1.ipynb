    "This guide is not meant to be a rigorous one, but rather a friendly one that allows you to understand how all of the pieces fit together, together with some visual aids to ease the understanding of neural networks.\n",

    "All starts here. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider \"smart\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Computer Science dedicated to the study and development of machines that can learn to perform tasks for which they were not explicitly programmed. It's based on the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main types of machine learning:\n",
    "- **Supervised machine learning**: is the direct imitation of pattern between 2 datasets. It is always attempting to take an input dataset and transform it into an output dataset (using the movies you like to predict the movies you may like).\n",
    "- **Unsupervised machine learning**: it shares a property in common with supervised learning. It transforms one dataset into another. However, the dataset that it transforms into is not previously known or understood. Clustering a dataset into groups is a type of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of methods in the Machine Learning toolbox, primarily leveraging Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which are a class of algorithms inspired by the function of the human brain and designed to mimic our own decision making.\n",
